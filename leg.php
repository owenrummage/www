OVERVIEW
=========
* LEG is an acronym standing for Linux Execution Gang
* The “Gang” in the name refers to the CPU cores of the processor, as they are a gang of cores that execute Linux and related processes
* LEG has 256 bit instructions, meaning 256 bit registers
* LEG will have two different types of firmware (which we call “vibeware”) UEFl (Unified Extendable Firmware LEG), and OpenFirmware
* The bootloader for UEFl will be an ELF (Executable LEG Format)
* The file in which UEFl uses is efl/boot/bootleg.efl
* The first LEG CPU will be released on leg day of 20xx
* Everytime the LEGStation crashes it makes the “My LEG” sound from SpongeBob Square Pants

STRASCIIADDMULDIVAVG
=====================
* This is an added instruction to LEG, it’ll be standard on all LEG CPUs
    * This instruction will take an an integer and a string
    * It converts each character of the string to their base 10 ASCII values and all added together
    * This new value is multiplied by the length of the string
    * Then this number is divided by the integer
    * Then we return the average of this new number and the integer

LEGOS
======
* LEGOS will only have one supported Window Manager and Desktop Environment
* LEGDE (pronounced LEG DAY) will combine the best elements of the popular Desktop Environments, it will also have a mobile variant
* LEGWM will have a floating and tiling version

MIDDLE ENDIAN
==============
* We start off with the word. The most significant byte of this word is stored in the middle
* Then we take the two words that are on either side of the most significant byte
* We put those words’ most significant bytes in the middle
* Repeat until the entire word is sorted
